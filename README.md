## Writing Team Internal - Quick Links & Useful Info

**The blog ideas and suggestions are added to this:**
- [**Project Board for Code Demos**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenMined/projects/32)
- [**Project Board for Long Form Blogs and Announcements**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenMined/projects/30)
- [**Project Board for Privacy Teaching Series**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenMined/projects/31)

These boards are where everything happens! Bookmark them.

You can use those boards to suggest new blog post ideas, claim unclaimed blog post ideas (by assigning it to yourself on github), and give updates on your progress. You'll also be able to view what everyone else is working on, and see examples of previous posts. 

“Many hands make light work” - if you see something that someone else is working on that you really want to help with, send them a message and offer your help! Our team has grown really quickly and it's large now, so you can be as busy as you'd like (writing all the time) or just write something every once in a while, there's no pressure.

## Good First Issues
If you're new and looking for a good place to start, you might want to [check out the items tagged as 'Good First Issues'](https://github.com/OpenMined/writing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue+%3Amortar_board%3A%22). You're also welcome to suggest your own blog ideas!

## How do we publish? 
You can draft your writing wherever you'd like, a lot of people start on a Google doc since it’s easy to share with others and collaborate. Once your blog is ready, you publish it by writing it up on our Ghost platform and hitting “publish”. It’s quite simple, don’t worry.

If you don't have a Ghost profile yet, send me (@Laura) a message on slack and I'll send you an invite to Ghost. When your blog is ready, submit the published link to https://socialmedia-submit.openmined.org. 

**Note:** Some people have received a lot of attention for their blog posts on the OpenMined blog. We recommend you update your “profile” on Ghost to include a photo, your name, short bio (ie ‘Student at X, 'Data scientist at X’, 'Writer at Y') and method for someone to get in touch with you (twitter handle is a good one) so you fully harness the attention that comes your way.
